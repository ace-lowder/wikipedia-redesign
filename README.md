## Overview

<p>I programmed a website (<a href="https://wiki-redesign.netlify.app/">wiki-redesign.netlify.app</a>) that mimics Wikipedia's layout and design. This project aims to improve upon the original Wikipedia layout, and acts a solid foundation for future development. The redesign was inspired by one of my favorite UI/UX youtubers, Juxtopposed.</p>

<p>I created this project to demonstrate my ability to make clean, responsive layouts. I chose wikipedia because it is content-heavy, with an emphasis on text over images. This unique content allowed me to showcase my layout styling skills along with dynamic text wrapping, use of icons, and responsive images. The website is built with a modern web tech stack; utilizing React for building the user interface, TypeScript to help catch errors, Next.js for rapid server-side rendering, and Tailwind for styling. I wanted to demonstrate my ability to take a design and convert it into a working, responsive website.</p>

## How it was made

<p>This project began as a Figma design that I turned into a functioning website. After studying the layout, typography, and spacing, I began coding each section into a compact component using React and Next.js. This systematic approach allowed me to develop the website in chunks, ensuring common components like icon buttons and links were consistent and reusable.</p>
