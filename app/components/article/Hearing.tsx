      <p>
        The domestic cat&apos;s hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to
        32 kHz.<sup>[72]</sup> It can detect an extremely broad range of
        frequencies ranging from 55 Hz to 79 kHz, whereas humans can only detect
        frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. It can hear a range of 10.5
        <a>octaves</a>, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9
        octaves.<sup>[73][74]</sup> Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its
        large movable outer ears, the <a>pinnae</a>, which amplify sounds and
        help detect the location of a noise. It can detect <a>ultrasound</a>,
        which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by <a>rodent</a> prey.
        <sup>[75][76]</sup> Recent research has shown that cats have
        socio-spatial cognitive abilities to create mental maps of owners&apos;
        locations based on hearing owners&apos; voices.<sup>[77]</sup>

      <ArticleSubheading>Taste</ArticleSubheading>
      <p>
        Cats have relatively few <a>taste buds</a> compared to humans (470 or
        so, compared to more than 9,000 on the human tongue).<sup>[86]</sup>{" "}
        Domestic and wild cats share a <a>taste receptor gene mutation</a> that
        keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving
        them with no ability to taste <a>sweetness</a>.<sup>[87]</sup> They,
        however, possess taste bud receptors specialized for <a>acids</a>,{" "}
        <a>amino acids</a> like protein, and bitter tastes.<sup>[88]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Their taste buds possess the receptors needed to detect <a>umami</a>.
        However, these receptors contain molecular changes that make cat taste
        umami different from that of humans. In humans, they detect the{" "}
        <a>amino acids glutamic acid</a> and <a>aspartic acid</a>, but in cats,
        they instead detect <a>inosine monophosphate</a> and <a>l-Histidine</a>.
        <sup>[89]</sup> These molecules are particularly enriched in <a>tuna</a>
        .<sup>[89]</sup> This, it has been argued, is why cats find tuna so{" "}
        <a>palatable</a>: as put by researchers into cat taste, &quot;the
        specific combination of the high IMP and free l-Histidine contents of
        tuna, which produces a strong umami taste synergy that is highly
        preferred by cats&quot;.<sup>[89]</sup> One of the researchers in this
        research has stated, &quot;I think umami is as important for cats as
        sweet is for humans&quot;.<sup>[90]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food,
        preferring food with a temperature around 38 °C (100 °F) which is
        similar to that of a fresh kill; some cats reject cold food (which would
        signal to the cat that the &quot;prey&quot; item is long dead and
        therefore possibly toxic or decomposing).<sup>[86]</sup>
      </p>
      <ArticleSubheading>Whiskers</ArticleSubheading>
      <p>
        To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable
        <a>whiskers (vibrissae)</a> over their body, especially their faces.
        These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of
        objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing
        air currents; they also trigger protective <a>blink reflexes</a> to
        protect the eyes from damage.<sup>[53]</sup>
