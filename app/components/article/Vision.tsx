      <p>
        Cats have excellent night vision and can see at one sixth the light
        level required for human vision.<sup>[51]</sup> This is partly the
        result of cat eyes having a <a>tapetum lucidum</a>, which reflects any
        light that passes through the <a>retina</a> back into the eye, thereby
        increasing the eye&apos;s sensitivity to dim light.<sup>[67]</sup> Large
        pupils are an adaptation to dim light. The domestic cat has{" "}
        <a>slit pupils</a>, which allow it to focus bright light without{" "}
        <a>chromatic aberration</a>.<sup>[68]</sup> At low light, a cat&apos;s
        pupils expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes.
        <sup>[69]</sup> The domestic cat has rather poor <a>color vision</a> and
        only two types of <a>cone cells</a>, optimized for sensitivity to blue
        and yellowish green; its ability to distinguish between red and green is
        limited.<sup>[70]</sup> A response to middle wavelengths from a system
        other than the <a>rod cells</a> might be due to a third type of cone.
        This appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than
        representing true trichromatic vision.<sup>[71]</sup> Cats also have a
        <a>nictitating membrane</a>, allowing them to blink without hindering
        their vision.

      <ArticleSubheading>Smell</ArticleSubheading>
      <p>
        Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their well-developed{" "}
        <a>olfactory bulb</a> and a large surface of <a>olfactory mucosa</a>,
        about 5.8 cm2 (0.90 in2) in area, which is about twice that of humans.
        <sup>[80]</sup> Cats and many other animals have a{" "}
        <a>Jacobson&apos;s organ</a> in their mouths that is used in the
        behavioral process of <a>flehmening</a>. It allows them to sense certain
        aromas in a way that humans cannot. Cats are sensitive to
        <a>pheromones</a> such as <a>3-mercapto-3-methylbutan-1-ol</a>,
        <sup>[81]</sup> which they use to communicate through{" "}
        <a>urine spraying</a> and marking with <a>scent glands</a>.
        <sup>[82]</sup> Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain{" "}
        <a>nepetalactone</a>, especially <a>catnip</a>, as they can detect that
        substance at less than one part per billion.
        <sup>[83]</sup> About 70-80% of cats are affected by nepetalactone.
        <sup>[84]</sup> This response is also produced by other plants, such as
        silver vine (<a>Actinidia polygama</a>) and the herb <a>valerian</a>; it
        may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and
        stimulating cats&apos; social or sexual behaviors.<sup>[85]</sup>
