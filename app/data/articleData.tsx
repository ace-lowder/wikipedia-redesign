      The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house
      cat, is the only <a>domesticated species</a> in the family <a>Felidae</a>.
      Recent advances in <a>archaeology</a> and <a>genetics</a> have shown that
      the <a>domestication of the cat</a> occurred in the <a>Near East</a>{" "}
      around 7500 <a>BC</a>. It is commonly kept as a <a>house pet</a> and{" "}
      <a>farm cat</a>, but also ranges freely as a <a>feral cat</a> avoiding
      human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability
      md:ml-4 to kill <a>vermin</a>. Its retractable <a>claws</a> are adapted to
      killing <a>small prey</a> like <a>mice</a> and <a>rats</a>. It has a
      strong, flexible body, quick <a>reflexes</a>, sharp teeth, and its{" "}
      <a>night vision</a> and <a>sense of smell</a> are well developed. It is a
      <a>social species</a>, but a solitary hunter and a{" "}
      <a>crepuscular predator</a>. <a>Cat communication</a> includes
      vocalizations like <a>meowing</a>, <a>purring</a>, trilling, hissing,
      <a>growling</a>, and grunting as well as <a>cat body language</a>. It can
      hear sounds too faint or too high in <a>frequency</a> for{" "}
      <a>human ears</a>, such as those made by <a>small mammals</a>. It also
      secretes and perceives <a>pheromones</a>.

      Female domestic cats can have <a>kittens</a> from <a>spring</a> to late{" "}
      <a>autumn</a> in <a>temperate zones</a> and throughout the year in{" "}
      <a>equatorial regions</a>, with <a>litter</a> sizes often ranging from two
      to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered{" "}
      <a>pedigreed cats</a>, a hobby known as <a>cat fancy</a>.{" "}
      <a>Animal population control</a> of cats may be achieved by <a>spaying</a>{" "}
      and <a>neutering</a>, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets
      has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
      extinction of <a>bird</a>, <a>mammal</a> and <a>reptile</a> species.

      As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the{" "}
      <a>United States</a>, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million
      households owning at least one cat. In the <a>United Kingdom</a>, 26% of
      adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats
      as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480
      million stray cats in the world.
